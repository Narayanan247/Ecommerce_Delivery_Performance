## 📈 Machine Learning Model
- Model: **Random Forest Regressor**  
- Accuracy: **~93%**  
- Features used:
  - Distance (km)
  - City pairs (warehouse → customer)
  - Courier partner
  - Payment type (COD / Prepaid)
  - Peak sale event indicator  

📌 Output: Predicted delivery days + delay risk indicator  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Delays are **20–35% higher for COD shipments**  
- Specific high-traffic cities show repeated SLA breaches  
- Long routes have higher prediction error  
- Avoiding risky routes can reduce violation cost by **12–20%**
